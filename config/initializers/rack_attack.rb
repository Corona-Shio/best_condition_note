class Rack::Attack
  ### Throttle Spammy Clients ###

  # If any single client IP is making tons of requests, then they're
  # probably malicious or a poorly-configured scraper. Either way, they
  # don't deserve to hog all of the app server's CPU. Cut them off!
  #
  # Note: If you're serving assets through rack, those requests may be
  # counted by rack-attack and this throttle may be activated too
  # quickly. If so, enable the condition to exclude them from tracking.

  # Throttle all requests by IP (60rpm)
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:req/ip:#{req.ip}"
  throttle('req/ip', limit: 300, period: 5.minutes) do |req|
    req.ip unless req.path.start_with?('/assets')
  end

  ### Prevent Brute-Force Login Attacks ###

  # The most common brute-force login attack is a brute-force password
  # attack where an attacker simply tries a large number of emails and
  # passwords to see if any credentials match.
  #
  # Another common method of attack is to use a swarm of computers with
  # different IPs to try brute-forcing a password for a specific account.

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by IP address
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/ip:#{req.ip}"
  throttle('logins/ip', limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/login' && req.post?
      req.ip
    end
  end

  throttle('signup/ip', limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/signup' && req.post?
      req.ip
    end
  end

  throttle('password_resets/ip', limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/password_resets' && req.post?
      req.ip
    end
  end
